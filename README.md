Here you can find the code for a bloglist app that students are asked to build in parts 4, 5 and 7 of the course Fullstack Open @ https://fullstackopen.com/en.

The exercises in part 7 involved refactoring the code to such a degree that caused the old tests not to pass anymore, and they haven't been updated.

**A live version of this app can be found here: https://code-example.fly.dev/.**
